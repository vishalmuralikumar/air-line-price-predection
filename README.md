Usage

1 Prepare your flight data in a CSV format with relevant features such as distance, departure date, and airline.

2 Run the Jupyter notebook airline_price_prediction.ipynb to train and evaluate the machine learning model.

Use the trained model to make predictions on new flight instances.

Data

1 The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the data directory.

2 It includes historical flight data with features like departure city, destination city, departure date, arrival date, airline, flight duration, distance, and ticket price.

Model Training

1 The machine learning model is trained using regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression,Decision Tree. 

2 The notebook airline_price_prediction.ipynb contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.
